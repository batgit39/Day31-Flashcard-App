# Day31-Flashcard-App
This is a simple flash card app to learn french words(considering you know english). One can switch the data to learn any desired subject.

The french word stays for 3 sec on the screen, then the english translation is shown.
If the user marks the word correct it is not shown again, and even if the user closes the app and reopens only the new words are shown untill all of them are finished. 
The words marked wrong are sent back into deck and shown again at a random time.
